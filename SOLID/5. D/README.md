## Dependency Inversion
This principle states that
a) High level entities should not depend on low level entities, but rather share a common Abstraction.
b) Abstractions should never depend on implementation details but vice-versa. This means that Interafaces/Abstractions should dictate the behaviour of entities and not the implementation details.
