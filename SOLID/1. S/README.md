# SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

The Single responsibility principle states that a class should only change for one reason. This concept is often misinterpreted to mean that a class should perform solely one operation but that is not the case. A class can in fact perform multiple actions but these actions are centered around the same concern/responsibility assigned to the class.
